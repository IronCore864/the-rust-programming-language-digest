# The Rust Programming Language

The digest for the [Rust book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/title-page.html).

For readers who don't have deep understanding of another programming language but want to learn Rust, it's highly recommended to read the original book. It's much more verbose but also much more in detail.

For experienced programmars who are already quite famliar with at least one language, reading this digest might work for you to get started with Rust quickly.

This digest also works as a "cheat sheet" if you forget something but want to do a quick search.
