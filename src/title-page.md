# The Rust Programming Language

## What

This is a digest of the [Rust book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/title-page.html). Still work-in-progress.

## Why

The Rust book is a bit verbose if you already have some basic understanding of any other programming language. So, I'm trying to create a (much) shorter version of it and still cover the most critical parts. The digest also works as a "cheat sheet" in case you forget something and want to do a quick search.

That said, for readers who are inexperienced in any programming language but want to learn Rust, it's still highly recommended to read the original book because, my god, it's good.
